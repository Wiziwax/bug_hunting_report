Bug bounty hunting is more than just finding vulnerabilities—it’s about understanding, experimenting, and evolving. Many hunters, whether new or experienced, face frustrations like, "Why can’t I find any bugs?" This journey is not about brute-forcing through lists of vulnerabilities but about diving deep into the structure and function of each target.

The mantra I live by is **“Hack to learn, learn to hack.”** This philosophy means working smart, not hard, and it can help you unlock opportunities others might overlook. Here’s a breakdown of my approach, which I’ve refined over years of hunting.

### Step 1: Understanding the Target Application

When I approach a new program, I don’t jump straight into hunting for bugs. Instead, I take time to understand the entire application, including its business logic and key features. If the scope includes wildcard domains like `*.example.com`, I map out every section, navigating through each link, form, and feature like a regular user. I keep Burp Suite running in the background to capture traffic, but my main goal is to grasp the application's purpose and the company's business model.

**Advice for New Hunters**: Instead of obsessing over OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, focus on understanding the target deeply. Search online for tutorials or explanations of similar applications, use cases, and industry-specific nuances. If you don’t find existing resources, go through the app repeatedly until you understand it fully. This foundation will help you spot anomalies and unique bugs that automated tools and checklists might miss.

**Mindset Shift**: Don’t aim to find a bug on the first click. Aim to understand the system. Once you fully grasp how the application works, identifying potential vulnerabilities will come naturally.

### Step 2: Digging into JavaScript Files and Analyzing APIs

After mapping the application, I shift my focus to JavaScript files. These files can reveal hidden endpoints, API keys, sensitive paths, and more. By analyzing JavaScript chunks and cross-referencing them with Burp Suite traffic, I can often uncover new subdomains or sensitive paths that could lead to privilege escalation or other critical vulnerabilities.

1. **Regex Searches**: In the Developer Tools, use regex patterns to scan for valuable information like API keys, endpoints, and URLs. Burp Suite’s traffic logs also help in identifying which API paths are active and how they’re structured.

2. **Cross-Referencing Traffic and Sources**: I use Burp Suite to capture API paths and cross-check them with JavaScript files in the browser’s DevTools. This helps me see if there are hidden API endpoints or features meant for premium users.

**Why This Works**: Combining traffic analysis with JavaScript exploration gives you a comprehensive view of the target. By understanding the API structure and other backend interactions, you’ll gain insights into areas of the application that are not immediately visible. This step alone can reveal a wealth of potential vulnerabilities.

### Step 3: Reconnaissance and Expanding the Attack Surface

Once I’ve covered the main application, I move to broader reconnaissance. This includes using tools and platforms like Google Dorks, Shodan, Censys, BinaryEdge, and GitHub to uncover related assets. This phase is about identifying subdomains, services, or applications connected to the primary domain but possibly overlooked in development.

1. **Dorking and Scanning**: Tools like Shodan and Google Dorks help me discover additional subdomains and open ports, expanding the potential attack surface.

2. **Automating Recon**: Automating certain steps can keep you up-to-date with changes on the target and quickly alert you to new subdomains or exposed assets.

3. **Keeping Up with New Techniques**: I often go on Twitter, Medium, and forums to learn new techniques, including simple one-liners that can yield significant results. Constantly refreshing your toolkit is key to finding those elusive, unique bugs.

**Lesson**: Recon isn’t a one-time thing. As you continue to explore, make a habit of periodically checking back for new assets or configuration changes. Recon opens doors to discovering hidden functionalities and unprotected endpoints that could lead to critical findings.

### Tips for API and Admin Dashboard Bug Hunting

In applications with admin dashboards or extensive APIs, I set up my environment with Burp Suite configured to capture and analyze traffic. Here are some additional techniques:

- **Sources Tab in DevTools**: Search for endpoints, domains, and sensitive data within the Sources tab. Regex can be helpful here to spot patterns that indicate API keys or hidden endpoints.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Copy API paths from Burp Suite and search for them in the Sources tab. This might uncover premium endpoints or undocumented features.
- **Regex Patterns for Sensitive Data**: Use regex to search for API keys, credentials, IP addresses, and more. Here are some useful patterns:
  - **API keys**: `r"[\'\"]([A-Za-z0-9-]{32,})['"]`
  - **URLs**: `r"https?://[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]"`
  - **IP Addresses**: `r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b"`

Combining these techniques can yield a comprehensive list of endpoints, including hidden features or API paths that the developers might not expect a regular user to access.

### Embrace the Unexplored: Go Beyond OWASP

Many beginners focus on the OWASP Top 10, injecting payloads into every field without understanding what they’re looking for. I was once there myself. But as I grew, I realized the importance of going beyond best practices and routine injections. Now, I focus on uncovering unique bugs—those hidden gems that don’t have a name because they’re unique to the target.

**Challenge Yourself**: If you feel like you’re stuck, take a step back. Look at the application’s flow, consider business logic flaws, and think creatively. Sometimes, the most rewarding bugs are the ones that don’t fit neatly into a category.

### Don’t Neglect Mobile Applications

Mobile applications, especially Android and iOS, offer another layer of vulnerability. I often start with simple checks on mobile apps: looking for insecure deeplinks, unprotected WebViews, and exported activities. Even if mobile hunting isn’t your strong suit, reading articles and reports can give you the knowledge to uncover serious issues.

For example, Android applications may expose sensitive functionality to malicious apps if not properly protected. I challenge myself to explore these aspects and encourage other hunters to do the same. Platforms like HackenProof have plenty of mobile-focused programs worth checking out.

### Conclusion: Stay Curious and Keep Learning

Bug bounty hunting is a journey that rewards curiosity and a willingness to learn. There are always new tools, techniques, and technologies emerging, and staying connected with the community—whether on Twitter, Medium, or bug bounty forums—can help you stay on top of your game.

Remember, the goal is not just to find bugs but to **understand** why they exist and how to prevent them. Embrace the unknown, stay patient, and always be ready to learn. **Hack to learn, learn to hack**—this mindset has unlocked countless opportunities for me, and it can do the same for you.

Good luck, and happy hunting!
